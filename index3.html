In just a few minutes you can sign up and get a business phone number that when called, can ring any of your employee’s cell phones or desk phones. You can also setup a recorded greeting that will present callers with options like, “For sales press 1, for support press&nbsp;2.”</p>

Soon after, we established a cross-departmental team called the “Growth Team”, dedicated to running experiments with the mission to improve our product and marketing efforts. The insights and adjustments we made through these efforts were very impactful. In a year and a half we were able to double our prices while increasing conversion 300% and nearly halving our&nbsp;churn.</p>

				<p>Emu Study is a concept mobile app that provides students a way to study on-the-go. Once users input their course material, they can press play and use voice commands to engage in a flashcards style learning experience. This way the user’s hands, arms, and eyes are free go on a run or wash the dishes while they study. I was inspired by user experiences that actually relieve you from interacting with a screen. I wanted to rethink how apps could be incredibly useful but demand less of our attention. There is a lot of opportunity in rethinking our reliance on visual interfaces to solve problems. I created a visual identity for the project that is playful and bright so that users can feel more light hearted in their&nbsp;studies.</p>

				<p>The Grip Designer is an e-commerce concept project that allows customers to put together a custom package of self-adhesive foam cutouts for their surfboard. These foam stickers provide traction while surfing and are an alternative to surf wax. I created a prototype that allows customers to set the dimensions of their board, and create a layout of how they want their board to look using TRXN's available foam stickers. Once the user is done designing, they can calculate the total cost of the stickers they've used, and click "add to cart" when they're&nbsp;satisfied.</p>

				<h2>THOTSWOP</h2>
				<h5 class="mb-3">Login Screen Interaction</h5>
				<p class="m-0">This is a concept project that I created to explore how illustration and animation can bring liveliness to tasks that might be annoying. Requiring people to identify themselves before engaging with a product is a user experience that is often neglected. Logging in often leads to frustration when users get their password or username wrong. I created this interaction to try to make the process surprising and enjoyable. Users are rewarded as they fill out the fields by completing the animation. Log in and sign up screens are often a user's first impression of a product, so it is a unique area to show some personality and set things on the right&nbsp;foot.</p>

In just a few minutes you can sign up and get a business phone number that when called, can ring any of your employee’s cell phones or desk phones. You can also setup a recorded greeting that will present callers with options like, “For sales press 1, for support press 2.”</p>

						<p class="">When I first started on this team, the on-boarding process for new customers was severely lacking. We noticed many customers signed up and never got started using the product. In order to get to the bottom of this, I enlisted several friends to sign up for the product and talk out loud what they were thinking. I also called customers who looked like they were at risk of not activating, and asked them if there was anything I could help explain. And finally I used an analytics tool called Hotjar to view heat-maps of clicks and screen recordings (to maintain our user’s privacy, sensitive information like names and IDs were obfuscated). Through these practices I developed an ability to guide people towards CloudPhone’s value. I also identified a lot of areas where I could minimize friction and streamline the user’s discovery phase.</p>

		    		</div>
		    		<div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto mb-4">
						<p class="">The first thing I did to tackle this problem was to create a dashboard on our web portal. This might seem like more of a retention thing, and it is, but it is also very important for activation. Dashboards are useful to new users because they offer a familiar place to return to and jump from one area of the application to another. The dashboard I designed features large buttons that take you to areas necessary to configure your account. The dashboard also features fun illustrations with verbiage that steers users to doing the two actions we have linked to high retention (placing their first call in the mobile app and creating a custom virtual receptionist greeting).</p>

		    		</div>
		    		<div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto mb-4">
						<p class="">The next big project for activation was setting up an effective tour. I designed an interactive tour that prompted new users to click on elements and navigate to different pages for a long thorough explanation of all of the features and services. But after deploying this tour we found that a very small percentage of people were actually completing the tour. So I tweaked the design several times and settled on a version that is less linear and allows users to discover at their own pace and encourages but does not demand next steps. We also made our tour multi-session so that we could introduce advanced tips and tricks and up-sell users who were further along in their activation journey. Our growing activation rate show this tour strategy has been very effective.</p>

		    			<p class="caption">Tinkering with the design of the tour improved our tour completion rate from 10% all the way to 54%! This might not sound like an impressive percentage, but people have different learning types. People who would rather explore and learn on their own are empowered to do so.</p>
		    		</div>
		    		
		    		<div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto mb-4">
						<p class="mb-2">There were several other things we did that lead to increased activation. I reorganized the navigation of the web portal to be more intuitive. I convinced the team to get rid of one of our features in the web portal that didn’t work well and was a huge distraction to the new user experience. I also got rid of unnecessary form fields and took steps to minimize clicks and actions needed to accomplish tasks.</p>
						<p class="">In a one-year time span we improved one of our activation metrics, people who signup and place a call in the CloudPhone app in the same day, by 385%! As a major side bonus we saw a dramatic reduction in churn, going from 4% to 2.4%. Now when I talk to new users about their experience, the conversation is much different. There is still room for improvement, but it is clear from the qualitative and quantitative evidence that we have made major strides.</p>

						<p class="">In May of 2017 I attended the Growth Hackers conference with several colleagues. Soon after, we established a cross-departmental team called the “Growth Team”, dedicated to running experiments with the mission to improve our product and marketing efforts. The insights and adjustments we made through these efforts were very impactful. In a year and a half we were able to double our prices while increasing conversion 300% and nearly halving our churn.</p>

						<p class="mb-2">The Growth Team consisted of a designer (me), marketing specialist, developer, analyst, and lead. Each week we would meet and discuss potential tests we wanted to run and present our analysis of the tests we had running. We had a scoring system for prioritizing our ideas that considered: impact, confidence, ease, and time needed to reach statistical relevance (ICE-T). This ensured that we were only working on tests that had a high probability of success.</p>
						<p class="">Some of the things we tested turned into larger projects once we had proof that we were on to something. For example, we changed the call to action (CTA) text on the buttons on our marketing website to be more focused on choosing a business phone number, rather than the larger task of setting up a business phone system. This resonated with visitors to our site and we saw a greater amount of clicks on those CTAs that were focused on choosing a business phone number.</p>

		    		<div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto mb-4">
						<p class="">In our previous implementation, users would choose a plan in the marketing website, and then enter a signup funnel where they chose a number and filled in their personal info. We realized we needed to move number choosing further up in our funnel. Now our homepage features a form to get started choosing a number. We made it so that you can either choose a number first or choose a plan first. I did all the design and front end development for this project.</p>

		    		<div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto mb-4">
						<p class="">Another thing we tried that had huge results was switching from a free trial to a money-back guarantee. By analyzing our users we realized we had a lot of new users who were not very motivated. Our theory was that if we switched to a money back guarantee, we would probably be lowering the amount of new users, but the ones who did sign up would be more motivated to give it a try and would turn into long lasting customers. Our hypothesis was correct and this lead to a huge boost in paying customers. I contributed to this project by analyzing user behavior on our various analytics platforms, and also changing messaging and graphics in our website to communicate an upfront payment.</p>

		    			<p class="caption">Some of our experiments were not successful. In the experiment depicted above, we tried to separate visitors to the website depending on the type of phone system they needed so that we could cater to them better. We think this alienated our base customer (micro businesses who don’t need desk phones) and lead to fewer conversions.</p>

						<p class=""> I worked with a team of finance technology consultants to create a very rough wireframe on Google Slides.

						<p class="">When I was ready to move to color, I spent some time looking at other finance applications, and played around with some styling options. I made some quick improvements to a logo they were already using, threw together a header area and some basic components, and landed on some colors and fonts. This gave me a basic idea of the look and feel. Then I shifted gears and went granular to design the individual components that would make up my design framework. I followed Atomic Design methodology to create a consistent and flexible library of user interface components.</p>

						<p class="">Once I was satisfied and had approval on a few screens, I made sure to setup my  design workflow to be as efficient as possible.

This way I don’t need to think as much about spacing, or creating components form scratch, or what colors to use because I already made these decisions upfront and setup my document correctly.</p>
